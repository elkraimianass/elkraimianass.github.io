                <h2>Project 1 : Privilege Management and Securing Active Directory</h2>
                <br>
                <p style="color: purple;"><strong> Enhancing Domain Controller Security and Access Control Measures.</strong></p>
                <p>This project centers on the robust security configuration of Active Directory (AD), critical for managing identities, permissions, and access within a networked environment. The initial phase focused on securing Domain Controllers (DC), which manage authentication processes and control access across the network. Various hardening measures were implemented to strengthen DC security, including disabling unnecessary services such as Bluetooth Support and Windows Media Player Sharing to reduce exposure to potential attacks. Additionally, physical security practices were enforced by restricting access to server rooms and maintaining strict control over patching and updates to mitigate known vulnerabilities.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To prevent privilege escalations, the project replaced default Group Policy Objects (GPOs) with custom, security-focused GPOs, tailored specifically for administrative roles. Backup strategies were a significant focus, utilizing Windows Server Backup to establish both regular and ad-hoc backup schedules, ensuring rapid recovery capabilities and data integrity for Active Directory. The project also integrated auditing tools like AD ACL Scanner, Bloodhound, and ADRecon to automate the analysis of Access Control Lists (ACLs), identifying permissions that could inadvertently allow privilege escalation. By conducting periodic, automated scans, the security posture of the AD environment was elevated, providing visibility into excessive permissions and supporting proactive security management.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p style="color: purple;"><strong> Strengthening Authentication and Adopting Granular Access Control.</strong></p>
                <p>The project placed a strong emphasis on refining password policies and authentication methods within Active Directory to safeguard against unauthorized access. This involved creating granular password policies for critical service accounts and IT administrators, using complex criteria (e.g., enforcing passwords with a minimum of 25 characters, complexity requirements, and a history to prevent reuse). Service account policies were specifically configured to support secure application management without compromising the AD environment, providing a tailored approach to account security.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Authentication mechanisms were further secured by disabling NTLMv2, a legacy authentication protocol, and enabling LDAP signing to protect against man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. The project also implemented a password rotation protocol for sensitive accounts like KRBTGT and DSRM, essential for preventing credential-based attacks, including the creation of “Golden Tickets” that could enable unauthorized access across the network.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A core aspect of the project was adopting the principle of least privilege. Users and service accounts were restricted to the minimum permissions necessary for their roles, reducing the risk of privilege abuse. This included developing a tiered access model to segment accounts by role and permission level, from regular user accounts to privileged administrator accounts. Using tools like Bloodhound and ADRecon, potential privilege escalation paths were mapped and mitigated, enhancing security across the environment.</p>

                <h2>Project 3 : Strengthening the security of a mobile financial application and a password manager: static and dynamic analysis.</h2>
                <br>
                <p style="color: purple;"><strong>Password Manager.</strong></p>
                <p>My objective was to assess the potential vulnerabilities of a popular password manager by performing static and dynamic analyses on its APK file. The static analysis was conducted using Jadx-gui, a decompiler that allows for obtaining the source code of the application from the APK. This enabled me to examine the Android Manifest.xml and string.xml files to identify sensitive permissions and potentially risky configurations, such as debugging mode or backup activation, which could expose the application's data to attacks. I also explored the code to identify any potential API keys or sensitive URLs that could be exploited.</p>
                <br>
                <p>For the dynamic analysis, I used Burp Suite to intercept network traffic and verify that the exchanged data is properly encrypted. By bypassing SSL Pinning, I was able to observe whether sensitive information was transmitted in plaintext. I also integrated Frida and Objection to inject live commands into the application, allowing me to test the robustness of its protections in real time. For example, I was able to simulate attacks on the master password validation and observe how the data is protected during an intrusion attempt. These techniques provided me with an advanced understanding of the security measures of this application and helped me develop solid skills in reverse engineering and mobile security.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p style="color: purple;"><strong>Mobile Financial Application.</strong></p>
                <p>In the static analysis phase, I used several tools to explore the source code and permissions of the application. With Jadx-gui and APK-TOOL, I was able to decompile the application to examine the AndroidManifest.xml file, which contains essential information about sensitive permissions and configurations, such as access to SMS messages or network access. I also used Ghidra, a reverse engineering tool, to inspect parts of the code in C++ and assembly to detect potential vulnerabilities and examine cryptographic implementations. These steps allowed me to identify specific features such as unique identifier authentication, encryption of sensitive data using AES, and session token management.</p>
                <br>
                <p>For the dynamic analysis, I set up a testing environment using an Android emulator (Genymotion) connected to Burp Suite to intercept network traffic and observe the security of data exchanges in real time. I bypassed SSL Pinning using Frida and Objection, which allowed me to capture encrypted data and simulate man-in-the-middle attacks. I also observed how the application handles location and network access permissions, noting the interactions with the device's GPS and wireless network.</p>

                <h2>END-OF-YEAR project : Implementation of an Information Security Management System (ISMS) compliant with ISO 27001:2022 for Securing Digital Twins in the Context of Industry 4.0</h2>
                <br>
                <p>The main objective of this project was to secure sensitive information of digital twins, by reducing the risks of cyberattacks and ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. In a context of proliferating cyber threats, this project addressed critical data protection challenges by supporting operational continuity and the resilience of the infrastructure.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Methodology and Implementation Steps : </p>
                <br>
                <p style="color: purple;"><strong>The PDCA methodology</strong></p>
                <p>also known as the Deming cycle or continuous improvement cycle, is a management framework used to systematically improve processes and products : </p>
                <br>
                <p><strong> PLAN : <strong> The planning phase includes the identification of critical components such as sensors, data storage, and applications, as well as conducting a risk assessment to detect vulnerabilities and potential threats, such as unauthorized access, data manipulation, injection of malicious data, and Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Security objectives are defined to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability, accompanied by appropriate security policies. Implementing strict access controls and monitoring mechanisms for employees with elevated privileges is essential. This could include applying the principle of least privilege and implementing identity and access management (IAM) technologies to limit the risk of leakage or alteration of sensitive data. Incident response plans ensure a rapid and effective response in case of an incident. Establishing a Security Operations Center (SOC) is crucial; this team would be responsible for continuously monitoring network activities, detecting potential threats using solutions like SIEM, IDS, and IPS, and responding promptly to security incidents.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong> Do : <strong> In the execution phase, security measures are implemented, including the installation of firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and the application of role-based access controls to ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive information. At the same time, training sessions are organized for staff to promote a thorough understanding of security best practices.</p>
                <br>  
                <p> <strong> Check : <strong> The verification phase involves continuously monitoring the Digital Twin environment, using IDS/Snort to detect anomalies and assessing the effectiveness of the implemented measures through penetration testing. Security audits cover essential topics, such as security protocols and incident management. The results of this evaluation allow for the analysis of the performance of security policies.</p>
                <p>Use of the MITRE ATT&CK framework for creating attack scenarios and implementing cyber security resilience tests. Conducting regular internal audits to ensure compliance with safety standards and ensure continuous improvement.</p>
                <br>
                <p> <strong> Act : <strong> Finally, in the action phase, the results are examined, and security policies are adjusted based on identified weaknesses, including updating procedures and adopting new technologies. The continuous improvement process is integrated to adapt the security framework in response to evolving threats and risks.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p style="color: purple;"><strong>Risk Analysis with the EBIOS RM Method</strong></p>
                <p>The EBIOS Risk Manager (EBIOS RM) method was chosen to manage information security risks. This method, developed by ANSSI, allowed us to break down the project into four specific workshops:</p>
                <br>
                <p> <strong> Framing and Security Foundation : <strong> This step allowed us to identify the resources requiring enhanced protection, such as personal data and network infrastructures. </p>
                <br>
                <p><strong> Identification of Risk Sources : <strong> Identification of threats (both internal and external) and vulnerabilities that may affect information security. This included the analysis of risks related to hacking, data theft, and denial-of-service attacks.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong> Creation of Strategic Scenarios : <strong> Development of high-level risk scenarios and identification of stakeholders to model threats based on strategic assets and define appropriate protective measures. Then, we describe a concrete simulation of a set of attacks (data manipulation and injection of malicious data, brute force).</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong> Risk Treatment : <strong> Selection of strategies to mitigate identified risks. We established a continuous improvement plan to ensure that security measures can adapt to new threats. </p>

                <h2>Project 5 : Comprehensive Access Control and IAM Solution Deployment: Securing Digital Identities with Keycloak</h2>
                <br>
                <p style="color: purple;"><strong> Implementing a Standards-Compliant IAM Solution .</strong></p>
                <p>This project aimed to design and implement a robust Identity and Access Management (IAM) system adhering to ISO 27001 and NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) standards. The objective was to create a secure infrastructure that protects critical resources while efficiently managing the lifecycle of user identities and access rights. The implementation began with a thorough exploration of IAM principles, covering identity management, access request mechanisms, federated identity, and Single Sign-On (SSO). Additionally, a normative analysis of ISO 27001 and NIST CSF provided guidance on relevant compliance controls for IAM solutions, ensuring the architecture meets international security standards.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A comparative study of open-source IAM tools, including Keycloak, Gluu, and FusionAuth, was conducted to identify the best-fit solution. Keycloak was chosen for its flexibility, extensive feature set, and compatibility with Docker, LDAP, and mail server integrations. The project documentation detailed the setup, including the creation of realms, client registration, and token configuration to manage user identities and authentication.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p style="color: purple;"><strong> Advanced IAM Configuration and Security Enhancements .</strong></p>
                <p>The second phase of the project focused on the advanced configuration and security hardening of the IAM environment. Custom access policies were implemented to align with the principle of least privilege, allowing users and applications to access only what was necessary. Integration with Docker streamlined the deployment of LDAP for directory services and a mail server for account verification, enhancing the security and efficiency of identity management workflows.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To strengthen authentication, Keycloak’s support for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and federated identity was configured, allowing secure SSO across multiple domains. The project also introduced granular access controls for privileged users and system administrators, monitored through real-time logging and auditing, as required by ISO and NIST standards. This layered approach ensured a comprehensive, secure IAM setup that not only complies with regulatory requirements but also strengthens overall cybersecurity resilience by controlling identity and access processes efficiently.</p>

                <h2>Project 7 :Threat Detection and Response Implementation of SIEM/XDR with WAZUH</h2>
                <br>
                <p style="color: purple;"><strong> Deploying a Custom SIEM/XDR Architecture with Wazuh .</strong></p>
                <p>This project involved the design and deployment of a robust open-source Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Extended Detection and Response (XDR) solution using Wazuh. The architecture was centered around a Wazuh server, responsible for aggregating security data from Linux and Windows agents. The deployment included securing the Wazuh server’s infrastructure, with each agent configured to monitor logs and security events and report findings in real-time. This setup allowed for a streamlined flow of information, enabling detailed visibility and prompt threat detection across all endpoints.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The project also involved customizing detection rules for specific attack types such as brute-force, SQL injection, and privilege escalation. With Wazuh's indexer and modular agents, the system could identify key indicators of these attacks, leveraging its compatibility with MITRE ATT&CK to enrich alerts with threat intelligence. These integrations helped create an actionable intelligence framework, enhancing the organization’s defense capabilities by ensuring comprehensive monitoring across all network segments.</p>

                <br>
                <p style="color: purple;"><strong> Advanced Active Response and Automated Threat Mitigation .</strong></p>
                <p>In the second phase, Wazuh’s active response feature was configured to enable automatic mitigation actions. This included blocking IPs involved in suspicious activities like network scans or unauthorized access attempts, all in real-time. To supplement this, VirusTotal integration was implemented to scan suspicious files across the network, triggering automated responses to delete or quarantine infected files, significantly reducing the manual intervention needed for incident response.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The project further incorporated File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) for critical directories, enabling detection of unauthorized file modifications—a key indicator of potential malware infections or insider threats. Advanced active response rules for SSH log monitoring and automated IP blocking were also configured to detect failed SSH negotiation attempts and escalate responses for potential brute-force attacks. The combination of these automated responses and monitoring rules created a dynamic and proactive security posture, demonstrating the effectiveness of Wazuh as an adaptable and scalable SIEM/XDR solution in a modern SOC environment.</p>
